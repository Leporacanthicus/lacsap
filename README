This is the a nearly complete Pascal compiler, based on LLVM.

The purpose of the project is mainly to learn how LLVM operates together with a compiler.

Among things NOT yet supported are:
* Started work on objects.
- Cross procedural goto.
- Good error handling. Now slightly improved.
- Proper type checking. Now better - but not perfect.
- Support for unsigned integral types. Some support.
- Constant expressions (e.g. const x = 7; type arr = array [1..x+1] of integer;)
- Refactor AST dump functions to use visitors.
- Separate compile units.
- Debug symbols.
- Stop using clang as the "linker". This may never happen...

Lots of other small and large things that I can't think of right now.

The above list is a rough "todo" list in prioritised order.
