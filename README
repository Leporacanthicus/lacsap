This is the early stages of a Pascal compiler. It is nowhere complete yet. 

The purpose of the project is mainly to learn how LLVM operates together with a compiler.

Among things NOT yet supported are:
- String variables. 
- test07 currently broken (boolean expressions, such as 7 > 6, do not become "boolean")
- Constant expressions (e.g. const x = 7; type arr = array [1..x+1] of integer;)
- The "with" construct. 
- Variant records are not supported.
- Proper type checking. 
- Goto statement.
- Usage of "text" files creates many type declarations - should only be one.


Lots of other small and large things that I can't think of right now.

The above list is a rough "todo" list in prioritised order.

Mats
