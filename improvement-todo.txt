This is a list of "things to improve in general". 

- Stop using TypeKind for base-types, use TypeDecl instead. Will make so many things easier.
  In other words, remove SimpleCompoundDecl, and use the CompoundDecl instead.
  This should also remove all uses of Types::GetType() - instead add Types::GetXXTypeDecl()
