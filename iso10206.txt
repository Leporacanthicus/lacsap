A list of features needed to fulfil ISO 10206 standard. This is by no
means a FULL list of features, but rather a list of things that I
think can be added with relative ease.

The existance of this document is by no means a promise of ISO 10206
functionality appearing anytime soon (or ever).

Types:
   Restricted types (Opaque types for modules) [supported by parser]

Functions
   writestr(s, p1, ..., pn)   { kinda like sprintf }
   readstr(s, v1, ..., vn)  { kinda like sscanf }

Modules

   New keywords:
     "module", "export", "import", "interface", "implementation"
