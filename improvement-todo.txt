This is a list of "things to improve in general". 

- Support integer types with variable size automagically (through type declaratio, e.g
  type byte = 0..255; should make an 8-bit unsigned)

- Use proper names for types.

- Add support for runtime checking of:
   * Nil pointers
   * dispose of NIL.
   * range check of pack/unpack.
   * Overflow check of sqr, trunc, round, succ, pred using llvm.*.with.overflow.iNN
   * Invalid argument for log, ln,sqrt, etc
   * chr needs range-check.
   * Check for zero divisor on mod, div and /.
   * Unknown 'case' label?
   * Range check for reading ranged values.
   * Range check for set assignment.

- Print source with errors.
