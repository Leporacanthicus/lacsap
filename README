This is the early stages of a Pascal compiler. It is nowhere complete yet. 

The purpose of the project is mainly to learn how LLVM operates together with a compiler.

Among things NOT yet supported are:
- String variables. 
- The "with" construct. 
- Variant records are not supported.
- Proper type checking. 
- Goto statement.
- Usage of "text" files creates many type declarations - should only be one.

Lots of other small and large things that I can't think of right now.

The above list is a rough "todo" list in prioritised order.

Mats
