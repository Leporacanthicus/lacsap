This is the early stages of a Pascal compiler. It is nowhere complete yet. 

The purpose of the project is mainly to learn how LLVM operates together with a compiler.

Among things NOT yet supported are:
Type declarations (pretty important)
Record (pretty important)
File/Text variable types
Pointers and dynamic memory allocation (and release thereof).
Proper testing.
The driver properly linking the runtime.
Lots of other small and large things that I can't think of right now.
