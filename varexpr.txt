A quick sketch on what needs to be done to resolve addresses in assignments. 

Declarations:
    x: integer;
    p: ^integer;
    arr: array [...] of integer; 
    parr: ^array [...] of integer;
    arrp: array [...] of ^integer;

    x := 7;     

- Find variable x's address
- Store constant 7. 
 

    p^ := 8;

- Find p's address. 
- Read p to find address stored. 
- store 8 in the address read. 

    arr[x] := 9;

- Find arr's address. 
- Calculate x * sizeof(arr[0])
- add to arr's address. 
- Store 9. 

    parr[x]^ := 10;

- Find parr's address. 
- Calculate x * sizeof(parr[0])
- add to parr's base. 
- Read this address to get actual memory address.
- Store 10. 

    arrp^[x] := 11;

- Find arrp's address
- read value from address
- Calculate x * sizeof(arrp^[0])
- Store 11.
