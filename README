This is the early stages of a Pascal compiler. It is nowhere complete yet. 

The purpose of the project is mainly to learn how LLVM operates together with a compiler.

Among things NOT yet supported are:
- Boolean expressions
- File/Text variable types
- Proper tests.
- Set variables.

Other work that is needed: 
- Store all nested data in one block.
- Local variables collide with global types and global constants - this shouldn't be the case.
- Dump of types should be "const"

Lots of other small and large things that I can't think of right now.

* Marks that "I'm working on it now".
