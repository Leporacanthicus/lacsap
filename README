This is the early stages of a Pascal compiler. It is nowhere complete yet. 

The purpose of the project is mainly to learn how LLVM operates together with a compiler.

Among things NOT yet supported are:
- Proper tests.
- Set variables.
- A "random" function (and perhaps a "set seed or similar", e.g. a randomize function)
- The "with" construct. 

Lots of other small and large things that I can't think of right now.

* Marks that "I'm working on it now".
