This is the early stages of a Pascal compiler. It is nowhere complete yet. 

The purpose of the project is mainly to learn how LLVM operates together with a compiler.

Among things NOT yet supported are:
* Constants
Boolean
Function/Procedure arguments.
File/Text variable types
Proper testing.

Other work that is needed: 
Store all nested data in one block.

* Marks that "I'm working on it now". 

The driver properly linking the runtime.
Lots of other small and large things that I can't think of right now.
