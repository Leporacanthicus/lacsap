This is a list of "things to improve in general". 

- Stop using TypeKind for base-types, use TypeDecl instead. Will make so many things easier.
  In other words, remove SimpleCompoundDecl, and use the CompoundDecl instead.
  This should also remove all uses of Types::GetType() - instead add Types::GetXXTypeDecl()
  It would ALSO help solve the problem with type compatibility between ranges and integer
  which is currently a bit weird.

- Support integer types with variable size automagically (through type declaratio, e.g
  type byte = 0..255; should make an 8-bit unsigned)

- Use proper names for arguments and typenames.
